# LedgerRun

LedgerRun is a policy-driven execution engine for ETF DCA.

You define the rules.
LedgerRun executes them automatically — safely, transparently, and repeatably.

## What LedgerRun Is

LedgerRun is **not** an investment advisor.
It does not recommend assets or strategies.

LedgerRun is software that:
- Enforces a user-defined ETF allocation policy
- Automatically executes trades via a brokerage API
- Maintains a full audit trail explaining every action

Think of it as an autopilot for discipline, not decision-making.

## Core Principles

- **Execution-first**: automation beats intention
- **Policy-as-code**: rules are explicit, versioned, and enforced
- **Glass box**: every trade is explainable
- **Safety by default**: caps, kill switches, paper-first workflows
